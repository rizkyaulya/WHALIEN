## Notice: This repository is deprecated

We have re-architected the Whalien Profit Switcher so they are now a fully-fledged with Huweishen data center facility

What does this mean right now? At the time of writing we have swapped over to the new structure so this repo is almost 100% overcast.




## FEATURE SUMMARY

GPU/CPU Mining script with intelligent auto-switching between different miningpools, algorithm, miner programs using all possible combinations of devices (NVIDIA, AMD and CPU), optionally including cost of electricity into profit calculations and  stop mining, if no longer profitable.
Features: easy setup wizard with adhoc working default (no editing of files needed), GUI-webinterface, selection of devices to be used, very low CPU usage.

- **Multi-Platform (AMD, NVIDIA, CPU) on Windows and Linux**
- **Profit auto-switch between mining programs and algorithm for GPUs & CPUs (optimized one for each vendor vs. one for each possible device combination)**
- **Profit auto-switch between pools (2Miners, 6Block, AHashPool, BaikalMiner, BeePool, BlazePool, BlockCruncher, BlockMasters, Bsod, BtcPrivate, Cortexmint, EthashPool, Ethermine, F2pool, FairPool, FlyPool, GosCx, GrinMint, Hashcryptos, Hashpool, HashVault, HeroMiners, Icemining, LeafPool, LuckPool, LuckyPool, MinerMore, MinerRocks, MiningDutch, MiningPoolHub, MiningPoolOvh, MiningRigRentals, Mintpond, MoneroOcean, Nanopool, Nicehash, Poolin, Poolium, Ravenminer, SparkPool, SuprNova, UUpool, Zergpool and Zpool)**
- **Profit calculation, including real cost of electricity per miner**
- **Uses the top actual available miner programs (Bminer, Ccminer, Claymore, CryptoDredge, Dstm, EnemyZ, Ewbf, Gminer, NBminer, Sgminer, SrbMiner, T-Rex, Xmrig and many more)**
- **Easy setup wizard with adhoc working default - click Start.bat and off you go (RainbowMiner will ask for your credentials, no hassle with editing configuration files)**
- **CLient/Server networking for multiple rigs, to minimize internet traffic and avoid pool bans**
- **Scheduler for different power prices and/or pause during specific timespans**
- **Build-in automatic update**
- **Mining devices freely selectable**
- **Finetune miner- and pool-configuration during runtime**
- **Bind/exclude devices to/from specific algorithm and miners**
- **Define pool's algorithms and coins**
- **Use unlimited custom overclocking profiles per miner/algorithm**
- **Easy overclocking of gpus (memory, core, powerlimit and voltage)**
- **Switch MSI Afterburner profiles per miner/algorithm**
- **Includes OhGodAnETHlargementPill**
- **Very low CPU usage to increase CPU mining profit**
- **Pause mining without exiting the RainbowMiner**
- **Full automatic update**

## CREDITS

The miner script has initially been forked from RainbowMiner, for our private use, only. We changed and optimized the script a lot to suit our needs and decided to exlusively developing it for Huweishen Digital Asset Management.
